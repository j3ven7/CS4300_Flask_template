Would recommend calling in and making a reservation, as they get busy later in the evenings **especially weekends**. Went for ax throwing and had a great time thanks to our instructor Chris! He helped us along the way, correcting our technique to get the most out of our time and money. Well worth it for sure. You won‚Äôt be bored the hour and fifteen minutes you‚Äôre throwing. They have games to have you engaged the entire time. At one point we were offered to use magnetic bow and arrows but chose to decline considering we were having fun with the REAL axes. In between events, you won‚Äôt be bored. They have an arcade waiting area, 1 token per game for all games except for the punching bag which only takes real dollars. Friendly staff and nice interior decorations. Will definitely go back for other events!!"",""I came here with my work team to play laser tag, and it was an interesting experience. I've played laser tag in California, and the setup for this one was really different. We had actual guns and they could be dangerous if used improperly; they were heavy and had potential to knock out people. The setup was fine, and there were a lot of places to hide behind although there were some spots where people hid and just stayed the entire game. The design could probably be better. The games were interesting though, and we had three types of games: longest-standing team, taking a box from our side to the other team's base, and a 15-minute free for all. I haven't been to other laser tag places in NYC so I'm not sure how they are here, but the space is small and guns were heavy."",""This was my second corporate outing at Indoor Extreme Sports LIC. We signed up for Black Ops laser tag and had a great time. Everything was extremely organized and on time. Our host manager for the evening was Marcus. He was fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out!"",""My son went to a birthday party here. You need to sign a waiver for your child and then register electronically at the front counter. The children were shown inside to the laser tag area. They put on helmets and vests and started running through a maze with their laser guns. There was a red team and a blue team which can change so the kids aren't always on the same team. Every single child had a blast. At this establishment there is also a big video game room, an ax throwing room (this is a scary adult activity similar to archery except you throw axes at a wall)."",""I came over to this place for Black-Ops laser tag, and I have to say that I really enjoyed it and thought that it was really fun. Two things that disappointed me was the cost and the service. The cost is very pricy, especially for only 1.5 hours (at least $45 a person) and during the games, referees ‚Äúhelping‚Äù us didn‚Äôt care about the rules of the game or let it be too fair. Although these things did occur, my overall experience was awesome. The laser-tag was very realistic and fun to play with friends your age, and the arena made it seem like we were actually battling. The food there also made up for the okay service. They had a variety of drinks and snacks that made every person in that room happy that day. Overall, great. Definitely deserves at least 4 stars.""}",4.3,"{amusement_park,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

No need to trek to Hershey, Sesame or Six Flags when you can have affordable fun right within the city limits.

Brave the swinging cars for an old fashioned thrill. Pro tip: park at the New York Aquarium, just a few minutes up the boardwalk."",""The famous Deno's Wonder Wheel ride. Don't be to scare to ride this big wheel. Just like most of this area in Brooklyn. It's a lot of landmarks, famous rides, spots to eat at and places to make a stop at. You have the ballpark, Aquarium, Amusement park and the boardwalk to enjoy the views of the sea.

If you have kids like mine  who wants to see the ride in action before they decide.  Be prepare to spend a long time. 
Always better to go in the evening. If you park in the NY aquarium parking lot.. it's a flat $20 for the evening.. no matter how long you spend."",""Iconic Coney Island bucket list ride, Check!
We went on the ferris wheel, views are great from up there. We avoided the swinging cars they just looked a little too vertigo inducing for my 1 & 5 year old.

On weekends they have fireworks."",""I used to really enjoy this place as a teen.I know maybe around 10 to 15 years ago they added some new rides, but I really feel its time for them to remodel and give this place a complete facelift.

Unlike a museum where you see the skeletons; this really makes the idea of dinosaurs come to life. They have a variety of different activities during the day, shows with sing a long songs, digging, etc. They have a passport book that kids can collect stamps in for participating in activities. You should bring water, sunscreen and a hat because it's in a field so can get very hot.

Well, after we played our room, we struck up a conversation with two tourists from Australia who had just played the Alien Invasion room. And the manager offered to let all four of us play Manhattan Mayhem ABSOLUTELY FREE! That's right!  Manhattan Mayhem was great fun! Unlike any other escape room I've done.  It was certainly not without it's challenges. Although we were four experienced players, there were quite a few times when we had to tap out and have someone else try a puzzle that had us stumped.  But we did get out with ten minutes to spare! What a great experience. Both rooms were so much fun, and the customer service was unparalleled!"",""Went with family...definitely tested the universe by locking us in a room...we had so much fun. We joked and figured things out collectively. The staff was great. Great light hearted environment"",""As a veteran of multiple escape rooms around the country, I really enjoyed this one. The theme and execution were well-done and, more importantly, logical.  If you work diligently you should be able to solve this room within the time allotted.  We only received a few hints and missed solving the room by only a few seconds!  My only suggestion would be to replace the wood block numbers with new ones.""}",4.6,"{amusement_park,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

It was really relaxing and exciting at the same time.

The shark tunnel was a beautiful sensory experience. The staff were friendly. The enclosures were well-maintained. Despite the weather, the outdoor exhibits were fantastic! The seals, otters, sea lions and penguins were all very active. We even got to see an otter training session. It's clear that the aquarium is committed to conservation and education- from the endangered fish breeding aquariums and sustainable coral growing aquariums, to the group of school teachers tracking animal behaviors to learn innovative ways to take the scientific method back to the classroom. Cannot recommend this place enough- one of the highlights of our NYC visit!"",""We visited during the winter, which meant a lot of the  activities were cold. There isn't as much to see as I had hoped, and it was disappointing considering the cost to drive there and the price of admission. A highlight, however, was the sea otter show. It kept us laughing and my toddler entertained. I'm sure it's even better in the summer."",""I come here at least once a year, but since they opened up the shark exhibit I want to make at least two trips a year. The shark tunnel is beautiful and loaded with different species of shark. I also love the sea lion show. No matter how old I am, or how many times I see it, it will never get old.

On one hand, it's a very clean place with friendly staff, well-kept animals, and a good location.

On the other hand, the conservationism is too heavy-handed for my liking. I understand that keeping our oceans, lakes and waterways clean and safe is important. I do.

I'd rather consume that information at my own pace, but I'm unable to do that here."",""Great time visiting at Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk. Lots of different varieties of fish and sea creatures. Seal feeding is fun to watch always. Jelly fish corner is very relaxing. Gift shop and cafe are right near the entrance. The best part is watching IMAX theater show after a long walk. Definitely recommend this place. Good price and great experience!!!"",""Diving with the sharks is a great show. That was by far the most captivating attraction. The staff patiently answered questions. My kids enjoyed the hands on exhibits like the jellyfish pool that's safe to touch. The seal feeding was also very nice. I liked how the museum continues in a circle through the second floor and back. It's a nice, manageable layout for taking young kids."",""Great experience for the whole family! We took our 1 y/o  to the aquarium and it was a blast for her. The staff were incredible and very friendly to her on her birthday.

The wing of the Islamic art This wing shows the development of this art from the seventh century to the nineteenth century. It is no exaggeration to say that the pavilion offers a comprehensive view of Islamic art. The pavilion contains works of art representing different stages of Islamic art, not only Arabic calligraphy and Islamic motifs, but also artistic pieces that reflect the development of Islamic architecture, the textile industry and the development of ceramics. The pavilion includes works from the ancient Islamic world of Arabia, Andalus, Egypt, Syria, India and Persia. The masterpiece of this wing may be the Damascene Hall, which embodies the magnificence of the art of Islamic architecture. The museum is not limited to its artistic collections, but occasionally offers artists from around the world or special performances of certain art stages or a particular country or continent. :: Photography of a lens \""Pierre Gad\""

Always something exciting going on at Brooklyn Center!  And at great prices too.  Stuff that you would need to trek into Manhattan for, but here it's at half the ticket price.

Just saw Step Afrika and it was a blast -- a super show and even though the Saturday performance was snowed out, they moved it to Sunday, PHONED US to tell us it was moved and we could use our Saturday tickets or GET A REFUND -- what theatre does THAT?!!

I know it is near New York, but it costs $57 per night.  Also, be forewarned, it cost $50 in tolls to cross the George Washington bridge with our fifth-wheel RV.

Before you give the town your hard earned dollars to stay in  a place like this. ( not monitored or in a safe area ) just know the following. The management here is horrible. They have no concious at all. The manager Cathy Ferrara  is so UNPROFESSIONAL. Background  ....  friends father had a camper here that he paid daily rates for because he lost his home and is on government disability checks come only on certian dates. Being that he has a 13 year old family dog  he can not  leave behind  and it's hard to rent with pets as we all know. His  son (25 yo) did all he could to get him set   up here for a few months. He was late on  payment so the manager Cathy called the cops and forced him to leave. Now this is understand me that someone's late on payment and what not but the fact of the matter is  me personally called up to setllte this matter  no one would speak to me about it . Then she was rude to people  I had call for me. She had her employees  who were so nasty on the phone  beside the man Frank who was trying to be so helpful to me in this stressful time. She didnt even have the decenisy to call me back in 2 business days. I'm not sure how inhuman  someone could be. This is town park of a community  that man lived in and contributed for years raising a family with all he had and a brain disability.  I'm so disappointed at how rude and  disgraceful  me and  my friend and his family were treated. I have a lot of family and friends who set up at the nickerson location that will no longer be contributing  to so I suggest if you have a heart look other places and save your money  it  goes to paying such horrible nasty people. I am  young and thriving in my career with lots of contacts I've come in the business I am in. They will regret  this harsh cruel treatment they gave me and my loved ones.  Just because he was late doesnt mean he doesnt have people to ask and people that are willing to help  justify his situation. 

 Cathy Ferrara its time to retire your rude and unprofessional and cruel cruel women with a major attitude. Karma"",""My favorite camground so far.

I was a camper for two of my years and my third I was a CIT (counselor in training). So as you can tell i have been through all of their experiences. 

Camper experience: As a camper you go on an an amazing trip everyday. BTW this is not a sleepover camp. So back to what I was saying. As a camper they have trips for everyone and.anyone.!! The trips can be super fun theme parks to icek skating! Overall the experience as being a camper is phonominal and I would very much recommend it. 

Experience as a CIT: the CIT experience is amazing. It gives you the feeling of what a job may feel like in the future. First of all you get to take care of cute little kids. Second you get to be given a little too after the summer you work. Tips are given on the amount of weeks you at work. When you work at Kim's kids it's not really work it's basically having fun with little children and at the end getting paid. You also get paid on the amount of skill and how much the children like you. For example somebody with four weeks of experience my get paid more than somebody that has 2 weeks of experience. 

Overall thoughts on this Camp are amazing. This Camp is a great way to spend a little bit of your summer. Also being a counselor in training a very good preview of what a real job would be like.

Thanks for reading bye!!"",""I just saw this camp in central park rock climbing these were young kids with no safety equipment no helmets harness climbing on a big Rock . Counselors
Were having problems getting up them selves and they proceeded to push these kids up by there feet with no stability .

The staff are great with the kids and each day they do different things so no 2 days are the same. The camp is well run and organized and we were given a calendar when our son started so we had a good idea of what was happening. they go swimming at least 3/4 times a week so the kids are out for most of the day.

Im so glad we found this camp! we had put our son one year perviously in the Park Slope Day Camp which was one of the worst experiences we have put our child into so we are so happy we found Kims Camp ! the best thing about it is the Kids have  fun!

It all started when the party bus picked us up at the hotel. The bus had a check engine light on and wasn‚Äôt working properly. We arrived at the church but it took forever because the driver did not know where he was going and was going in complete circles. We asked the driver if he was lost and he admitted he took a few wrong turns.

Now here is the really bad part, once the ceremony was over at the church, the owner of the limo company informed me that the bus would not start. He said that a sensor needed to be replaced and a replacement coach bus with no bathroom would come pick up our wedding party. My first thought was they knew the check engine light was on since the morning, why didn‚Äôt they try to fix it when the mass was going on? That would have given them 2 hours to install a new sensor. I proceeded to tell the owner that I needed the party bus because it had a bathroom. My 7 month pregnant sister was on board and needed a bathroom because of her situation. At this point, there was nothing we could do but wait for the coach bus.

So the coach bus came and picked up the stranded wedding party from the side of the road in Elizabeth, NJ. My wife and I left in a separate limo to Lambert Tower. The wedding party was supposed to come meet us in the backup coach bus. The major problem was that mid ride the coach bus decided to stop on the side of the highway for 1 hour and a half because the driver was informed to do so by the owner. When the wedding party asked the driver multiple times how come they were stopped, he responded with the same answer: he had another job to go to, and the owner was coming back with the fixed party bus to relieve him. The coach bus was needed elsewhere. Because of this 1 hour and a half delay, we were only able to take one picture together with  our wedding party, because we literally had 5 minutes to snap photos and leave. I paid so much money for a photographer and it was so sad that we missed out on so many great photos! I understand things happen, but all the bus had to do was just go straight to Lambert Tower and not stop on the side of the highway. That would‚Äôve changed everything. 

Finally we all arrived at the reception. We arrived at 6:45 pm. Cocktail hour started at 6:30 pm. We were all supposed to arrive at the reception for 5:30 pm for pictures and to settle in. We just could not believe the day were were having.

The following week after my wedding I spoke to the owner and he claimed that the bus only sat on the side of the highway for 10 minutes and the reason for this was so he could switch buses because there was traffic anyway. I told him that‚Äôs not what the bus driver told everyone. My father and multiple groomsmen told the bus driver please do not switch the bus, let‚Äôs just keep going because we are already so late. The bus driver did not acknowledge their requests and admitted the coach bus had another job to go to. According to all 26+ people on board, the bus sat on the side of the highway for 1 hour and a half. The owner lied to me to cover up his mistake. The owner said he had a GPS tracking system in the bus that would prove he was right about the 10 minutes, but when I asked him to email it to me he refused. If he were honest, he would have sent me his records. I asked the owner for a partial refund, which he said was not possible.

They completely ruined our day and were very unprofessional. The owner was so rude when I spoke to him over the phone and did not offer any solution to take responsibility for his wrong-doing. He wouldn‚Äôt even let me speak and talked over me every time I spoke. I paid so much money for these limos and the service was absolutely atrocious! I should have received some sort of refund to compensate for a terrible day, I didn‚Äôt even get a simple apology! I am extremely disgusted with Route 22 Limo‚Äôs service. The worst part is that I will never get that special day back again! All I can do is warn everyone about this limo company and the dishonest business they are running. I urge everyone to stay far far away!!!!""}",3.2,"{casino,night_club,travel_agency,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

Also the submarine has excellent diagrams about the history of this important navy ship and explain how they were able to save it from the scrap yard and bring it from the west coast near Seattle to its final resting place here in New York City. I can not recommend a visit to this museum enough. As an American we have all paid for each of these military items and they are one of the reasons that we are a great country and survive in a world full of challenges for a democracy."",""American history at it's best. A wonderful variety of planes and history of the intrepid and the submarine.  Great place to have a fun outing for adults & kids. Its a little pricey but well worth the experience.  The grounds are clean & a lot of security to feel safe. Definitely bring some snacks for the kids."",""Great way to spend half a day. Lots of exhibits inside the aircraft carrier as well as lots to see outside. So many highlights from seeing Blackbird (Lockheed SR71), Space shuttle, Concorde to name but a few. One of the highlights was speaking firsthand with one of the veterans who served on the ship during one of its many journeys. Highly recommended. There are a few steep staircases if you want to head up to the bridge, but otherwise access is very well catered for throughout the ship."",""Very cool place, nice location and easy access. A great spot for enthusiasts. They feature an extensive collection of military aircraft and equipment. Most areas of the carrier are accessible and there‚Äôs also a submarine and a Concorde for you to visit. 
The space shuttle enterprise has its own pavilion, a huge exhibit dedicated to space travel and the shuttle program.
Worth a visit when in NYC."",""This was an awesome museum! My son is a huge aviation buff so he loved it. The tour of the Concorde was definitely the highlight of the visit. They had a drone exhibit when we were there that was really cool too, makes you think of what the future holds. I would definitely recommend visiting.""}",4.6,"{museum,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

You can purchase tickets online and obviously they have different tour levels, purchasing online will save you a lot of time and purchasing the reserve ticket will also get you in the priority boarding queue. I purchased them right from my phone once I saw the line to purchase tickets. 

The line waiting for an empty ferry is actually quite long on a daily basis, they do have more than one ferry transporting back and forth which makes the line move a little faster. There is only so much room on the ferry and on a hot day, the wait can be miserable in the sun so be sure to squeeze into the crowd when boarding the boat to ensure you're part of the cut off, having to wait for the next ferry. 

The ferry ride is relaxing and on a hot day can help to cool you off. Looking at lady upon approach to the island liberty closeup is something quite spectacular and considering the difficulty they faced in getting the foundation of the statute initially built, its even more amazing closeup. 

The tour will also take you to Ellis Island which is well worth the time and extremely informational. The old hospital on the island is also really cool to see and they do have a tour which would allow you to see parts of the old hospital which I at some point will have to do. I thoroughly enjoy spending time on Ellis island not just for the history lesson and opportunity to get a close up of the awesome architecture but also just sit back and look across the water at the magnificent skyline. 

This is a good relaxing way to spend the afternoon.

Morocco or Bust
By Jennifer Michels

Abdelhay Elanbassi parlayed his knowledge of this Mediterranean country into a new career

What do you do after hanging out for a few years in your native Morocco, driving Hollywood film crews around the country, and growing up as the child of a Club Med employee? Abdelhay Elanbassi started to believe he should be in the travel business himself.

Elanbassi, now president and owner of Sahara Soul Travel in New York City, had his own rental car agency in Marrakech and would subcontract out his services to various agencies and tour companies. He would take actors on photo shoots or provide them with transportation to and from the airport, and he would offer his expert knowledge on the country as a tour guide. He realized he had many connections in the luxury travel business, such as knowing all of the local drivers and the restaurant owners.

Elanbassi says travel and tourism have been in his blood since he was young. His father is about to retire as a restaurant manager for Club Med, and the movie production business was tied to his car rental agency business, which also took him places.

While he still owns that business, he moved to New York five years ago and began working from home, where he and his wife, Christine, who has lived and worked in 30 different countries, founded the travel agency. Sahara Soul now sells one niche only-tours to Morocco.

\""I think I'll stay in the business,\"" Elanbassi says. \""My business is booming, and I am competing with people who have been in the business for 15 years.\""

The reason it is going so well is the level of service Elanbassi provides and his connections, he says: \""I used to work for companies like Abercrombie & Kent because I subcontracted to a local travel agency. So I'm giving the same service, but for less money.\""

His specialty is small customized tours in which he sets up teas or dinners with Moroccan families in their homes. He also does a good wedding business.

The rest of his agency is built on pluck and confidence. A friend of his who is a computer genius started his own computer programming business and helped him build his website. And the rest has fallen into place. He relies on friends and contacts for whatever he needs. He does not do airline ticketing but says he does all the rest. And he is a member of ASTA, OSSN, IATA and IATAN.

It also helps that Elanbassi speaks English, French and Berber, a tribal mountain language from Morocco. Agents who have never been to Morocco do not understand the language barriers or how to get around and arrange things, he says.

\""I specialize only in Morocco. I can do other countries, but I like to do things I'm really good at, and that's Morocco,\"" he says, adding that he puts together \""a whole experience\"" for the traveler. \""I know everything-the area, the people, the villages and the restaurant managers.\""

He also sells various theme trips, such as a \""Jewish Heritage\"" tour, a \""Grand Golf\"" tour, a \""Magic Marrakech\"" package, the Sacred Music Festival and an \""Ultimate Morocco\"" package. The latter starts with a private pick up at the airport in Casablanca, a visit to Rabat and to gardens and beaches, and on to the ancient fortresses of Meknew. It includes the holy city Moulay Idriss, the ruins of Volubilis, Fez, the Royal Palace and the Jewish Quarter. The trip also features a Sahara Desert experience on camelback with a Bedouin guide, visits to Berber villages and possible sightings of Barbary apes, and a night under the stars in a nomad tent. It continues on with a stop in the Todra Gorge, popular with rock climbers, and through the High Atlas Mountains.

Even though the trips he arranges are grand, Elanbassi likes to keep the groups small. \""I do mostly first-class and luxury trips, so most of our trips are private,\"" he says.

But he also books family reunions, corporate events and other group trips. Part of his business philosophy is, \""Whichever wonderful journey you choose, you will benefit from Sahara Soul Travel's exceptional quality and expertise. \"""","""",""""}",4.8,"{travel_agency,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

The general atmosphere of rich-white-person-discovers-the-orient that dominates the gift shop (expensive Om throw pillows, Herman Hesse novels, etc etc) was thankfully absent in the exhibits themselves. The museum takes its area of focus (Buddhism) seriously and has a good mix of historic pieces and work by contemporary artists. As an added bonus, it's free Friday evenings."",""The food was amazing.  I went with my daughter and she loved it. My only complaint was the bacon was to hard but EVERYTHING else was amazing so I am giving them a 5 star nonetheless."",""This peaceful museum became an unlikely favorite of mine. I'm neither scholar nor student of Eastern religion and tradition. Yet, I return again and again to find truly interactive installations, superior contemporary works and engaging displays of artifacts. On a recent trip, I stepped across an artist's water pond...and noticed the shrine room has expanded to include chairs and shared meditation beads. This museum is truly a model for others to follow.

Breakfast in the morning and coffee in the coffee and we enjoyed the fireplace on both days. A gorgeous retreat to make you feel elegant and spoiled."",""The high tea at the Pembroke room was lovely, the sandwishes and scones were quite tasty. The one negative is they leave the same tea leaves steeping in a big pot so your tea gets more and more bitter, and instead of getting you new leaves when you want a refill like at other tea houses I've been too, they just add hot water. So the tea only tastes amazing if you have it during the first 10min."",""We went for the afternoon tea and were underwhelmed. At one of the highest price points we've paid, it was our least favorite tea to date. Our waiter was lovely, but the food was bland and boring. They only gave us one scone each, and one set of jams and cream for 4 people. Altogether I left full, but I was surprised by how little was served. Although the tea was refilled without needing to ask, and was placed on heaters to keep it warm. The dining room is so cozy and small, it all feels very intimate.

It is in a great location right by Lincoln Center on Upper West Side, easy to and from Newark Airport especially. Room was comfortable, clean and good shower. Nice little bar in the lobby and Frank a terrific barman. Also the rooftop bar is worth a try too.

Some good places to eat very close by as well."",""Even though the sign had some problems, this place was great. Pretty large rooftop spot, lots of room inside, and plenty of bartenders to readily get you your next beverage.

Penthouse 808 Experience - cramped, overpriced bottle service spaces
- We went here on 12/31/2017 and had a great time so we decided to return on 12/31/2018. Sadly they removed the half-circle style seating (now located outside the check-in desk), and replaced it with one continuous bench with several small tables spaced about 3 seats apart.
- The sections were so small groups kept moving into neighboring seating, and moving tables aside to make more room for their groups.

Seating is comfortable, not overcrowded  Music was phenomenal  Highly recommend the Jazz standard."",""The Jazz Standard is the first jazz club I have been to. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday in 2018 and I was blown away. I knew I would be back. We told some friends about it and they displayed interest. Nearly a year after the first visit we came back and our date the first time around became a double date this time. We saw the Jimmy Greene quintet and they were awesome. I bought one of his CDs after the show. For food we got 4 BBQ platters and 4 sides. The baby back ribs were super tender, glad we got two of that order. My girlfriend loved the brisket. Their biscuits were our favorite side but that isn't to knock the Mac and cheese or creamed spinach. The price, the quality of food, and the music earn the Jazz Standard 5 stars in my book."",""This is easily one of the best jazz clubs in the world. Different music throughout the week, lots to keep you curious. The food and staff are both amazing. Go for the second set for a better seat and a chance to talk to the musicians. And there is usually a student discount."",""Jazz Standard has yet to let me down. Set in a cozy basement den, I get to enjoy three of my favorite things all at once: good food, strong drinks, and live jazz. Even on a Sunday night when I'm usually more liable to stay in and gurd myself for the week, I can drop in for an evening show and feel renewed when I walk out.  The service is great and you can tell they get a kick out of the music as much as I do.

If you are a cognac sipper this is NOT the place for you. They have tons of whiskey and if that is your thing then you will be pleased. No mint leaves so they don't make mojitos.
The bartender was kind of boring and what he suggested once I told him what I liked was not appealing. At all. It was only 5 people in the spot and I felt like the bartender would much rather continue his conversation with two gorgeous women who were staff and a gentleman I assumed was the manager. 
The sweet potato fries were great and the wings were alright. But the real kicker was the bill. For 2 drinks, fries and wings the bartender gave us the wrong bill which was over $100.  
When they do something more with that bar and get a better bartender I may go back. But it's highly unlikely. 
Tons of dope spots on the Lower East Side, for me this ain't one of them."",""Three floors for different music and vibes.

CONS 
Dress code is supposed to be impressive attire. No hats, sneakers, work boots or anything close to a sweat suit. What we saw was all of the above. Normally not a problem, except I dressed how they asked me to, only to feel overdressed. That was disappointing.

Lots of people, great atmosphere, friendly staff. 4 stars because it was a little hectic trying to find a place to sit, but that could also be attributed to the sheer amount of people inside.

You can find a lot of things to do there: zoo, lakes, castle, playground, etc. You can play many sports like baseball, volleyball, tennis, go swimming or skiing. Central Park is huge and has a nice view of the city. 

There you can find many animals, like ducks, turtles, many types of birds. You can fish on the lakes (have to return what you got). 

Bridges is another thing, there are many of them, really nice and iconic like Bow Bridge. 

Conservatory Garden is a beautiful place in which people go to relax and appreciate the flowers. 

One of my favorite places there is the Shakespeare Garden, the colorful flowers and the arrangements are wonderful.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art is also there on the East Side of the park, a huge museum with great pieces of art, a must-go in the city.

An activity a recommend is taking a bike and ride the whole park is a really nice experience and it will take you about one hour. 

There are also boats you can rent and spend a really nice time in The Lake."",""Such an amazing park. In many ways, you can forget you're in a HUGE city when you're in the park. I walked all the way across the park, from south to north. I knew it was ambitious, but in real life it was even larger and more impressive than I understood.

This is a great spot for photos while visiting the city too - an iconic photo spot for sure. Central Park is the perfect spot to bring kids too. You can enjoy watching the toy sailboats, find the Alice in Wonderland statue, or take a spin on the carousel. If your looking for an adult outing, you can enjoy a glass of wine at one of the few restaurants inside the park. Another handy tip is that cutting through the park by foot is usually faster, and more enjoyable, than taking a cab across the city."",""Gorgeous place to visit. We rode bikes here and it was very very enjoyable. Of course you can see famous movie scenes along with celebrities at times. Highly recommended!

Just until here you‚Äôll feel so you really have to visit this place. BUT it‚Äôs worth every cent. 

They‚Äôve maintained it so neatly, even though it‚Äôs winter there were so many animals outside and some animals sensitive to weather was kept indoors. Since it‚Äôs winter there was no stores opened inside for food, luckily we carried our own food. 

There are so many animals, at some point I forgot I‚Äôm in middle of New York City, except when those irritating flight take off landing sounds, as few airports are near by.

We were able to see American bison, lion, tiger, bears, deers, alligators, wide range of birds, monkeys and so many other animals. 

carousel ride was very nice and we were able to enjoy it since it wasn‚Äôt crowded. Must visit place for every age. Kids will love it and of course adults will too. If you visit in summer you‚Äôll probably need two days to cover whole area. 

Enjoy."",""Amazing experience. Expensive, but very well designed for both a \""exotic animal\"" experience, but also an outdoor, naturalistic feel.

Take the time to review the map before your trip and decide what places are a must see when you get there. 

I recommend parking furthest away from your favorite attraction, arriving at the park early and going to that location first. It will be a long walk there, but better to do it early in the day when you have the most energy. Then make your way back to where you parked. 

Certain attractions are seasonal. 

If you love visiting zoos and aquariums then the membership may be the most cost effective option for you. 

The children‚Äôs zoo alone can easily captivate the little ones for the day.

Adventure Scuba is a great place for learning. I can't imagine how they could have been more helpful. They did not make a hard sell but we ended up buying a few things because Tom's explanations were so intuitive sounding to us as beginners.

The captain stopped the boat in many places for us to take great photos of New York, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty.

The captains are very friendly and knowledgeable, and the itinerary hits all the highlights. During the nice weather, being on the water is very refreshing, and it's a great way to avoid the smell and discomfort of the city in the summer. In colder weather, the warm suits they hand out will keep you toasty. It's a must-do in my book for anyone visiting New York--or anyone who lives here and wants to get a fresh, new  look at their city."",""The tour was great.  We had Captain Joel, and our 90 minutes on the NYC waterways was fantastic. He was super informative, made sure we were warm and comfortable and gave us tons of fantastic info about NYC.

I attended the landmark forum which is their foundational course. And I left angry! They do such a good job taking advantage of people who feel hopeless, lonely, and helpless so they take the full curriculum of courses (which is worth probly thousands of dollars on total) and then pressure them to convince their friends to attend as well. 

It's immoral that they exploit your past trauma, make you almost addicted to the way they teach you only to have you to come back for more classes. The forum leader also pulpit punishes any non-compliant behaviors and peer coerces you to buy more of their courses! It felt like Nazi for me! It's no wonder people say it's a cult. 

I feel sorry for the employees and volunteers working for landmark. They are the ones being brainwashed and taken advantage of while some fat cats there are making so much immoral money!"",""This is a scam! Save your money. I have wasted 2 days of my life. I didn‚Äôt go in the 3rd day. It‚Äôs a torture sitting on uncomfortable chairs for 10 hours and more. Break time never comes and even on break they give you assignments to do. It will confuse the hell out of you. We are let go at 10 and gives you assignment and write letters when you need to go to sleep and wake up early next day. Then they pressure you to sign up for more which cost $1000. Your life is in your hand. Who are they to show us life????"",""Best experience of my life! Understand it‚Äôs a bit costly, $845, but it‚Äôs such an investment for your life.  

I Couldn‚Äôt stand the first 2.5 days, its Friday-Sunday 9am-10pm, free on Monday, then Tuesday evening 7:30-10:45pm. I was angry and confused during that time frame. But, on Sunday evening, it all changed. I have never felt so free and liberated about life. 

I would highly recommend it if anyone wants a life changing experience."",""A friend paid for me to attend.  Reminded me of a mixture of tactics from my time as a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness where they create group coercive peer pressure and pulpit bullying for those who don‚Äôt comply or challenge what‚Äôs on stage.

For individuals with trauma pasts, their curriculum will actively seek out retraumatization as evidence of the powerfulness of their lesson plan.  It's morally irresponsible. You may get an emotional high from participating, but I imagine that has more to do with the effective emotional manipulation tactics they employ through isolating you from outside connection for hours at a time, abusive withdrawal for lack of compliance, and intense group acknowledgement and rewards during compliance.

It may add value for some people but I look back at how I felt and things I felt pushed into while there and actively cringe.

They actively cheapen it by continuously making overtures for sales of additional products at the end of the seminar while actively requiring you to bring a friend to graduation on the fourth day where they‚Äôll get a special discount for joining.  They actively ask people to hide uncomfortable things during that last session to show others how great their time was.  Everything about this place is a red flag."",""Life changing experience! I took a variety of courses at Landmark over the past three years and I've seen a drastic transformation in my finances, social life, and family relationships. The instructors here are doing remarkable work, bringing families back together and healing to those affected by traumatic events.

A year ago it took 8 or 9 months to get elevator issues fixed, with elevators consistently not working, even got stuck in one once.

This is where I wanted my Mother's headstone to be made. My Sister's and I had a vision, of what we wanted our Mother's headstone to look like. And when I saw it for the very first time, It took my breath away. It is one thing to see something on paper or on a computer. But to see the finishing results, and it is everything that you imanged it to be and more, I am still speechless. I want to thank Angel and the rest of the Payless Monument staff for their kind and thoughtful words, and for always being professional."",""pay less, get less. Bad attitude from this company. Took forever with NO communication unless I reached out to them first. Finally got my mother's headstone installed about a month past the date my family was originally told and there is a damn sticker on it for Payless Monuments! Shameless and disgusting. Advertising on a headstone? Gross. I DO NOT recommend this company at all. Their rep Andy is not a very understanding person, in a business where I would imagine you need some display of understanding and compassion. When they sent the cemetery deed back certified mail, it was never delivered because, guess what? People work during the day and are not home to sign for certified mail. I explain this to Andy and he tells me to go to the post office because it's most likely just sitting there. Really? That's the solution? I'm at work before the post office even opens and don't get home until after they are closed, but that's his solution. I explain to him further that sending it first class with tracking would have been just the same and most likely would have been back to me by now, over 2 weeks later. Anyway, go elsewhere for your headstone. This company doesn't know how to handle people properly. I'm just glad it was two years after my mother passed and not two months because I would hate to see Andy treat a newly grieving son, daughter, husband or wife like he did me."",""From the time my sisters and I stepped into Payless Monuments looking to order a headstone for our mother, we felt a warm and friendly vibe and knew instantly this was the place we wanted to order the headstone from. We had visited some other monument places previously and those places were all about adding additional charges for this and that. However, Payless was all about fulfilling our wishes for our moms headstone without breaking our pockets with extra charges. The headstone we purchased took 5-6 months to arrive because it was made out of the country, and it came exactly when they told us it would come. I made several phone calls to the staff to check the progress throughout this process, and everytime I called Angel, Jessica and Danny were always courteous and answered all my questions. My mother‚Äôs headstone was installed by the time we requested it to be installed and our entire family is happy with the finished product. It was a pleasure doing business with them."",""I want to thank Payless Monuments for such a wonderful job they did with my Aunts tombstone. Jessica and Angel were very nice and professional.

I had to wait in a lot of line. It would be easier to order tickets online with site you want to visit then using this pass. Everywhere required a reservation to get into it. You can book ahead of time to make life easier. This is no time saver at all. At least for two people. Little disappointed. Other cities these past get first priority than general admission."",""This pass is exceptionally good value.  We got the pass for 4 attractions which worked out at $96 each.  We used the pass for the Hop on- Hop off Bus tour ($34.50), Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Immigration Centre ($18.50), 9/11 Memorial and Museum ($26) and Rockafella Centre Tour ($25). A reasonable saving but the passes also give you queue jump access to avoid waiting in long lines at each attraction, the pass is incredibly easy to use and comes with a detailed guide on all the attractions available,  where to find them and how to access them with your pass.

We waited the expected time of 4 hours without any confirmation email. When speaking to \""Julia\"" who I assume is a generic name for their customer service team, they were as unhelpful as possible. They referred us to a number who kept us on hold which cost ¬£10 of phone credit. When reinformed that calling and speaking to a customer care agent was not an option they consistently repeated the option of  speaking to someone over the phone. Would not recommend using this service. Luckily they refunded us but as expected, will take 3-5 working days."",""Perhaps this was my misunderstanding, but I thought we'd get to skip the lines if we purchased a 4+ attraction Explorer pass. Year's ago I bought the City Pass and got express entry--huge time saver--into multiple NYC attractions, this was not the case with the Explore Pass. We still had to wait in line after line. Several NYC attractions make you wait in line for a physical ticket even if you already have a mobile ticket (ex. Top of the Rock). i'm going back to the City Pass."",""Do. Not. Recommend!

Much like the other reviews, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in the New York City Explorer Pass. Unlike what they advertise (the whole explore as you go without planning ahead!) is a ruse to get you to purchase.

If we had known, we would‚Äôve had to make reservations at the attractions a head of time and get the tickets for them, we would have never purchased the pass. We thought we could just use the pass at the attraction and be fine. That was not the case!

They do not refund for unused attractions. So the attractions you are unable to get into due to not having a ticket or a reservation, you will not be refunded for.

We wasted time and money driving all over the place to visit attractions only to be declined once we got there.

Instead, go ahead and book reservations and tickets in advance directly through websites. Save yourself the time, hassle and money. Customer service has no mercy. 

I hope after hearing customers grievances the policies will be more transparent and I hope other customers decide to take their business elsewhere until this company does so. I can‚Äôt stand deceptive business. This company needs to right their wrongs with their customers.""}",4.5,"{travel_agency,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

The bus was a treat clean, air conditioned  with comfortable seats. However the selected restaurants staff were not accommodating at all. The dinners were pre-fixed with no deviations and meals were mediocre at best. The hotels accomadations were okay but only one really was first class. The tours to the sites were great, informative and well planned. 
Sandra prepared reservations, boats, buses and everyone well in advance.  She is a treasure  
 Walking sneakers definitely needed for tours they can last for hours.  

Overall after 2 weeks everyone in the tour became friends. We had a great time. If participants could select their meals from the regular menu it would make a world of difference. 

Sonia"",""ABSOLUTELY THE best dentist EVER!!! Dr. Rania Scander is amazing, I can't say enough amazing things about her! My aunt is actually one of her patients and recommended me to her, however she's in NJ and I'm about 50-60min away in NYS. I figured I would try her out since I haven't had much luck up in my area and not many dentist up here do root canals on molars. As I drove up I thought it was the wrong address bc it looked like a wedding venue spot but sure enough they're offices. 
I'm a bit of a germ-a-phobic so I tend to be very particular and critical especially when it comes to my mouth haha. CLEANEST office I've been to yet and I'm in my 30's. 

100% recommend even with the travel time!!

Dr. Scander was also very accommodating with her time in respect to my restrictions bc of working in NYC and commuting etc.
Most importantly she's honest and isn't just trying to make money! My regular dentist told me I needed 2 root canals and told me that with my insurance it would still cost me nearly $2,000!!! When I went to Dr. Scander she told me I only need 1 root canal and that it would cost me about $250 after insurance!! Hell of a difference!! When I told her my dentist said I needed 2 root canals she showed me the x-ray and reviewed everything with me, answered ALL of my questions and concerns thoroughly and even showed me the insurance break down for payment.""}",3.6,"{travel_agency,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

Best Regards,
Tan Family"",""I had two-day trip to Christmas village and  Ice sculpture expo. It is the worst trip experience because of the worst tour guide Theresa! She is the worst tour guide ever. 

Attitude:
She had bad attitude to some of tourists especially Chinese. She had no respect for us. She described our snack as ‚Äúsmelling like dead mouse‚Äù even though we were still eating it. Plus, no one around us smelled it. We asked people around us if they smelt anything, they looked confused and said did not smell anything. However, after the tour guide has spoke with us and after we put the snack away, she spoke loudly in the public to point that someone in the bus was eating something smelly to force the Chinese to put snacks away. She described them as ‚Äúdead mouse‚Äù and ‚Äúcat‚Äôs poop.‚Äù And whatever she‚Äôs doing we‚Äôre aim to educate us to respect the American culture. We just wondered why she only spoke in Chinese. 

Professionalism:
she is not knowledgeable at all. She came without any preparation. Couldn‚Äôt explain any places we visited and her tone was like she‚Äôs murmuring. Sometimes, she explained one thing in two totally different meanings in Chinese and English. 

Service:
At the afternoon of the day one, the tour guide told us we would eat buffet for dinner and was ready to pick up money from us. But my friend and I had no interest in eating buffet. We told the tour guide that we might want to wait to see if the area offered something else other than buffet. If not, we will pay her the money, there is no need to make additional stop or wasting other‚Äôs time. Then she replied that ‚ÄúCome on, you guys are working at the buffet restaurant, Why are you guys not eating it?‚Äù (We NEVER said that we work at buffet or restaurant). It seems like she judged us by our background. 

Don‚Äôt sign up for the trip if you don‚Äôt want to eat ‚Äúdead mouse.‚Äù"",""My family taking the 3 days Canada tour to Niagara fall and Toronto last week, and its a unforgettable experience.

If anything, the addition of great slides and activities is always welcome and adds to the amazing experience you have here. There is a section for kids (and people too scared to go on the ‚Äúbig boy‚Äù rides), so it‚Äôs extremely family friendly. Shoutout to the rides VooDoo Encounter and Volcanic Revenge. These are some of the best rides there, and they give you a really fun thrill whenever you go on them. In the kids‚Äô area, there are four levels, with one of the levels almost at the level of the scary rides. If that‚Äôs not enough, there are two hot pools that you can relax in. If hot pools aren‚Äôt your thing, there‚Äôs a lazy river where I‚Äôve even slept. There are sprinkles of water that are really fun to pass through; this place is really good for you and a kid. However, there are some things I don‚Äôt like about the place, but maybe can‚Äôt be helped. The changing areas are unhygienic and I‚Äôve almost slipped on dirty water. Also, since I‚Äôm vegetarian, there are very few eating options there, and we are forced to bring food from home.

Recently I had some something growing on my driftwood, and I texted them what it may be. No response for two days, so I texted again asking 4 days after, they said they would let me know the next day... they never did.
When I asked the following day if David ever saw this, they said he's been just too busy to respond. I said \""OK, let's still do the next service\"", and then they proceed to tell me that the service would need to be **Double** the price of last service.  That is a gross misjudgment so I was not too pleased by that.

I asked to get my driftwood and fake plants back 3 days ago, and also if they could provide the rubber pieces for the canopies that he ripped but unfortunately I have yet to get a response back yet.

Accessibility issues: 
-Hills are extremely steep. I would definitely not count on moving a wheelchair on one's own; have a friend or helper to push up the hills or slow your descent. Also consider skipping some exhibits which are up the steepest hills, like the barnyard animals (sheep, pigs, etc). 
-there are handicap accessible bathrooms as well as single stall companion restrooms that can accommodate a wheelchair and helper. The companion restrooms are located near the carousel. 
-Some terrain surfaces are more challenging to traverse than others. Some of it is plain asphalt, but other surfaces are textured for authenticity/theming, which may be harder on wheelchair users. 
-there are ramps in/to all buildings and amenities. I did not see automatic door buttons on all the buildings, though. 

The complex is clean and looks \""expensive\"" . If you went here a decade or even a few years ago, it's worth a return trip. 

Consider the membership to save money if you plan to return several times over the summer."",""Wow, this place is even better than before!  Tons

Had to add for Day 2
Pool / lazy river shutdown for 45 minutes because of fecal contamination. Get out of pool. Went to room and our room smelled like a pot factory. Thankfully the hotel moved us to another room, in a sold out hotel. Packed up moved to our upgraded room after some dinner. Back down to the pool 6 hours or so and 20 minutes later the pool was evacuated again for the same reason.

The boys had a great time on the water slides and I spent a relaxing day sitting in the sun, reading in the warmth. Nice change from what was outside. The hot tub was great. It's nice that they let you bring your own snacks and drinks. The food there is ok but expensive."",""My experience was a bid jaded because we stayed in a one bedroom suite with 8 of us.  I tend to like A LOT more privacy then this, but this obviously wasn't the resorts issue.  It's good to know they allow that and have bedding for it.  

The park itself was a fun, self contained water park.  My daughter was 3 at the time of our visit and loved it.  We live relatively close so don't feel the need to stay over and I don't think I\""ve ever seen discount tickets without staying.  

I did deduct one star because the room smelled a little musty to me, nothing I would complain to the hotel about, I think it's the nature of a water park hotel with carpeting.  Not much you can do about it.

I wish I had the time and energy to do all of the courses.  Hands down the longest course I had every been on.  The staff were very informative and helpful in making sure everyone was safe.

However, if you find yourself in a bind, the staff can help or easily lower you down from the course at any time.  I would highly recommend this place."",""This is a fantastic place for kids and adults to get some exercise in the outdoors and get some adrenaline going. The courses are very well designed and the safety equipment works well and is not intrusive. They have different courses for different levels including beginners as well as a really cool zip line."",""If you are reasonably athletic, budget more than 3h and do what is needed to get on course 6, you may have to go through previous 5 courses to get to it.

They also applied a method: if you don't pass challenges, you still get to continue with the story. With the Deep Space adventure, we didn't pass a certain challenge, but still got to the ending. In the last room, we still managed to beat the final challenge and end with the \""Best\"" ending and a decent score (92).
My girlfriend, her two best friends, and I went to 5 Wits. We bought the 3 adventures for $29.99 deal.

We decided to bring a canoe this year for that reason and that was the best decision. There are many islands to explore. I also highly recommend taking your canoe/kayak out for a midnight cruise.

The Waterfront sites at Meacham Lake are the stuff of legend. Very few campsites in the Adirondacks offer swimming in fresh water a mere few feet from where you camp. Fish Creek does, but you are right on top of your neighbors in the next site. Not at Meacham. By spacing the sites as they have, there's a small patch of woods between each one, giving a very private experience.

Meacham Lake is one of the jewels of the northern Adirondacks, and our time there was amazing. 

The only downside were the owls! A couple just happened to land in a big pine tree at our site at 3 am, and started a very lively conversation! But, a nice long nap in the sun the next day baked away the eery memories.""}",4.6,"{campground,park,lodging,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

Theyvhave a great store with everything you could need. They have an arcade, horseshoe courts, playground for the kids and more. They have an inground pool and lots of lounge chairs to sit by the pool. The campsite were level and you could do campfires as well. Definitely worth booking a spot in this RV park if you're heading to Lake George."",""We were placed behind the store which was in front of a highway so had to listen to racing traffic the whole time (the entrance to the campground was the other side of the building). Felt like we were on display. We weren't even in the campground. Our electric wasn't working correctly and we went in twice and told them our concern. No one ever asked us whether it got better or even checked any connections (everything was good on our end had to be them). Would not recommend unless you're part of a \""Good Sam\"" club because those seem to be the only ones that matter. Did not feel welcomed at all. If they told us about the highway when we made reservations we would not have stayed there. Will never go back to this campground."",""Traveling in a 38 foot coach we stayed 4 nights in a site for big rigs. The site we had lacked gravel and when it rained our pad turned into a mud pit. Is it that hard to put a little gravel down on the dirt? We did notice the sites in the very front of the park did have a good amount of gravel and were level. There are a lot of full-time residents in this park, sometimes when you have this many full-time residents the park gets a little trashy, but this park is very clean. If you have a dog, there are plenty of areas to walk your pet. This park is located in a quiet area. If we were to go back we would only stay in the front part of the park."",""Campground was well kept and facilities were the best of all campgrounds we have ever been at. Sam in the front office was great as well. Security on the campground was poor where a camper was injured and security did not call for medical assistance or intervene when intoxicated campers began to out of line with those helping. Left grounds a night early and was asked by Sam to share with owners, waited half hour to oblige with kids waiting and owner did not offer any refund or even follow up with apology.

The other staff members were quite pleasant and made the stay worthwhile. Everything could use a coat of paint and the showers were unclean. I met some very nice campers while we were there and they were the only reason we stayed the whole time. If you replaced Gina and Mike with two people who put on a happy face and took care of the campers, the park would be a better place. We saw multiple campers get into fights with Gina and Mike.

My Aunt Hester had a cabin in Pocono Mountains.   I was about 4 or 5 then and the only thing I can remember is playing in a little stream that trickled down a hill on one side of my aunt's cabin.  Her cabin was on top of this hill and my Dad sat on a blanket with our family and  friends . They had kids close to our age and we played in the creek as the adults would oversee our activities. During our visits we always had fun together.  My Aunt and her boys kept the cabin until the day she passed away.  By that time I was in my 20's and starting my own family. 
It wasn't too far beyond that , the Allegheny National Forest came into conversation again.
My husband and I  bought play toys ...a snowmobile and motercycles/ off the road bikes. Our Daughters were in the double digits in age and  didn't want anything to do with dirt bikes, but fell in love with snowmobiles.....and Allegheny National Forest.
We rented cabins and it  was a great getaway during the winter. Pennsylvania is beautiful and if you never visited you are missing a very picturesque state.  Back in the 70's the trail rides for snowmobiles were plentiful, but the interest for snowmobile riding was few.
We were actually in the mix of a few people who started a Snowmobile Club to create more interest. I worked for a short length of time for a company that sold recreational play toys and gear in the area I lived .  We didn't live near the Forest, but the Forest was  perfect,  safe place to stay out of trouble. The four seasons were so beautiful in the mountains. It was great to be outdoors.
 Getting back to nature is what I'm all about.  I am in my 70's now and with Harry. We have been together for 21 years and he is the same way. We enjoy being outside and have the best stories about the beautiful , magical experiences we have seen and felt while  Nature surrounded us. We all need a variety of experiences to add to our memories and I suggest trying road trips, bycycle riding, hiking , horse back riding and so much more. Our National Parks are the place to go and are safe for our families. Magical Memories are the most eye opening, soul cleansing, heart warming experiences one can ever have.

It would be nice if they separated RV's, listening to a generator can displace the feel of being outdoors.

Honestly, we were so paranoid while we were there we really didn't enjoy our stay. No we will not be returning.

I literally saw the male owner take a yogurt out of the hands of an adult woman who was eating it by the pool. Really tacky.We too were yelled at for going 4mph when it was 5mph zone.

Very good spot to bring kids. In fact the reason I noticed the reviews was because I was looking to go camping one more time this season. I wouldn't return if it was a dump. And I WILL go back. Next year even plan on bringing my nephew's for a long weekend because of how family friendly the place is.

#2 The DON'T overcharge and the prices are reasonable. I had one payment problem because the wife accidently wrote down our credit card number wrong. Her husband called  mine and they cleared it up real quick and POLITELY. They are professionals here.

#3 I think the wife may be shy (like myself) but that doesn't make her unfriendly. I NEVER once got that impression. I did get a friendly smile and wave whenever I passed her. Wow! How rude! üôÑ Didn't see her hubby much but when I did he was also friendly. And they aren't suspicious... they're protective of their business. You can tell they are on the lookout for riff raff and that's a GOOD THING. Drunks, pot smokers, party animals...you don't worry about them ruining your trip like at other campgrounds because you KNOW they aren't tolerated here. Makes me wonder what the people complaining were planning on doing before they realized they couldn't.

#4 SOOO clean. I watched the hubby clean the  bathrooms and showers at least 4 times in one weekend. Only campground showers that didn't make me feel like I was going to catch something by standing in them.

The museum is small but that makes it manageable, I would say 1-1.5 hrs is all you need to cover most of the exhibit. We caught the Japanese woodblock print exhibit on loan from Suracuse U.

I would like to see the Museum expand to include a cafe, they do have room downstairs for group events that could probably be cornered off for a small coffee stand with pastries, that's all you need  really. Great collection, courtesy of the paper mill old wealth. ;-)

My only quip was that I am a little suspicious as to the authenticity of some of the works. The family actively sought after works by some masters, working through dealers in Manhattan. There was pressure and obvious incentive for dealers to find the 'right' art within limited time frames. It is unknown but entirely possible that to please the sponsors and earn commission, dealers could overlook the origin of the work, or even order copies, and pass them off for authentic with all the necessary \""expert\"" opinion (paid a hefty fee for their verdict). Overall, the world of fine art collecting seems rife with perverse incentive and potential for large scale fraud. Just something to consider as you ponder how such great works could end up in the hands of American social elite. It's not just this collection, it's all collections worldwide.

I used to visit this place when they had the old loft which was cool because you could get neat costumes and lots of trucker hats (and you could keep the hats if you wanted).

The library is great if you like Christian books and the occasional fantasy novel. The computer runs fairly well but bring your own printer paper because the paper here is all moist from the humidity. We found a cannon and played with it. Don't play with the air horns though, got yelled at for that.

The food is great if you haven't had home-cooked meals in 7 weeks. There are typically baked goods, swedish fish, and pringles in big plastic bins and you can just help yourself and tell people it's yours. If you're ever in a bind as far as athletic shorts, close-toed shoes, lacrosse sticks, or soccer cleats, you can pretty much borrow any of the ones you find on the shelves.

There was also some confusion with the food, where pizza was listed on the neon sign but not the menu, and pizza was out and made(for employees, I presume), but they wouldn't sell it to us because they didn't know what to charge for a single slice. Eventually a manager showed them where to enter it on the computer, but it was just bizarre to be told \""No, I can't sell you the slice of pizza that you're looking at.\""

Still, the adventure pass was a good deal. The outdoor go kart track was sincerely fun, even for the adults. The laser tag was long and exhilarating. The bumper cars are great for the younger kids.

I can certainly understand the strict parking policy if the motel was fully occupied, but we were the only ones there and we should have at least been able to have 3 parking spots for the 3 rooms that we rented.  This would have allowed us to leave 1 vehicle in the parking lot.    There are no microwaves in the room.  The rooms are aging and the door knob and lock on our door was extremely difficult to open.  Taking several minutes each time to get in the room.  Not fun when it's -18 degrees outside.  Complained about this to the front desk and was told that the lock is old.  That same day we went to the lounge to relax in front of the beautiful gas fireplace.  We asked the front desk to light the fireplace, but was told that the person who knows how to turn on the fireplace was out and wouldn't be back until late.

I asked her to stop yelling in front of my child and told her I was uncomfortable even staying there..she kept calling my 36 month old a brat and told me she was kicking me out of the hotel. I asked for a refund for the room which she refused. She made us go in the office dripping wet to negotiate what she would give me back. Since she wasn't going to refund my money I said we would just stay the night. Went back to the room to change when she started pounding on the door over and over scaring myself and my son..she was yelling we can do this the easy way or the hard way so I called the police for help. The officer stayed so I could get my things out of the room and then arranged for me to stay at another hotel that the police department paid for as long as I didn't tell her!!

The itinerary was customized to our requirements. The staff was professional, friendly, and very helpful. Our driver in Ireland, Kieth, was exceptional. Highly recommended!"",""My wife and I signed up for a tour of Southwest Ireland. The tour guide was excellent and saved the day. The facilities left a lot to be desired. First of all, we signed up for a tour with 12 persons. Instead what we got, with absolutely no advanced notice to us, was a tour with one other couple who, thankfully, were from Toronto and spoke English. In the first hotel, near Shannon Airport, there was no elevator and we had to climb two flights of stairs to our room. At check in they never informed us you had to make reservations for dinner and so were not served dinner. The Inn was hosting a wedding and drunken wedding guests, at 2 AM were roaming the halls trying to find their rooms and shouting to each other. Later in the tour, at another hotel, we got a room with no working shower. A final celebratory dinner was cancelled on the last day with no explanation."",""Our trip with Hammond Tours greatly exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we met our driver guide, Seoirse Clancy, at Dublin Airport the morning of April 2nd, until he dropped us at our hotel in Dublin the afternoon of April 13th, we were wowed by the countries (the Republic and Northern Ireland), their people, the landscapes and, even more so, our driver guide.  While he had previously been an experienced guide on educational bus tours, we were his first clients for whom he was also the driver. He let us know this immediately.  We could not have had a better experience.  Anyone who knows what it is like to drive in the more ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù places in Europe knows that, unless you stick to the primary roads, driving and navigation can be ‚Äúexciting,‚Äù even with GPS navigation.  As we were extremely willing to assist Seoirse with the navigation challenges, we learned far more about where we were and where we were going.  We did 21 of the 32 counties and Seoirse knew a lot about each one.  He gave us numerous recommendations on what to see.  The more he knew about us the more on target his recommendations were. 

Seoirse arranged for us to have guided tours in Derry and Belfast with experts in those areas. He did this because he felt we would learn more from someone who was more knowledgeable about the area.    In Derry he approached the guide as a walking tour was just about to begin.  In Belfast he pre-booked the tour. Both were excellent.  From these two gentlemen, we learned a great deal about recent Irish history and the aftermath, seeing it ‚Äúup close and in person.‚Äù  We enjoyed cathedrals, a basilica, monasteries, castles, a jaunting cart ride, two ferry boat rides, two filming locations for HBO‚Äôs Game of Thrones, Irish music and dance, very good to great hotels, significant progress on expanding our family tree, dramatic landscapes, single track lanes when in quest of ancestral origins (and at other times too), and great food (Irish, Chinese, Thai and more‚Ä¶).  What a fantastic experience!  We highly recommend Hammond and if we ever return to Ireland there is only one guide driver (who we now regard as a friend) that we would consider using."",""Ultimate professionals, knowledgeable and courteous.  I had the best vacation of my life because of this company.  My wife and I went on a band tour in Ireland with the Young Dubliners in March 2018.  Our driver was John Costelloe.  He seemed to know everything about everywhere we went but what made it so memorable was John could deliver information in a warm and personal manner that was more like he was having a conversation with you as an individual rather than speaking to fifty people over a microphone.  He did sing a few songs for us.  He also gave us useful information on some of the differences we would experience along the way (for us first timers).  We had never been to Ireland before and I was concerned about being tied to a bus for 9 days.  The itinerary was full but never felt rushed.  The busses with clean and well maintained.  If there was an instance where we would be on the bus for much more than an hour, a \""comfort\"" stop was built in.  All the hotels we stayed in were comfortable and in every one, they went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.  Mike, also from Hammond, was always on scene to work out any kinks that popped up.  We were a group of 100 but moved through the country side, sites and towns with ease because of John, Mike and the other driver Luke.  They were a strong team and their professionalism paired with the love they possess  for their country equate to a first class experience for us.
I highly recommend this company for anyone who has a chance to tour the Emerald Isle."",""Went with local band, Get Up Jack, to Ireland in April 2016. The whole trip was planned out with time for shopping and just relaxing. The bus tour drivers was great, super friendly, knowledgeable and even sang to us. At first I was unsure of a bus trip but it worked out wonderfully! We have everything taken care for us, even our luggage brought to our room.

We had an awful experience last night driving back from NYC, and yes I know buses do not have to be equipped with seat belts but you would think in the light of recent terrible accidents and tragedies that would be installed, especially when they have a much older driver (nothing against the elderly) but when someone is having difficulty seeing and staying awake they should not be hired to drive a bus with 50 people on it. The driver kept falling asleep, riding over the lines, in the middle of the highway, over curbs, rarely used the wipers even when visibility from rain was minimum at best."",""I had the pleasure of going to the culinary institute. It was quite an experience. Staff were delightful and very knowledgeable. Food was great and just an enjoyable outing for the day."",""Worst trip of my life. Not only did we leave late waiting for stragglers, which is against their policy, we also arrived late. This replaced our comfort stop which we had called two days before and received a verification on. We were left unprepared for a five hour bus trip and had no time upon arrival for food or toilet because we were already late. We were then late again to our next stop due to tour guide abondoning handicap patrons to their own devices to return to bus. And neither the driver not the tour guide knew where we were going. We then took an excessive amount of time home five hours when it should be three and our comfort stop was denied until we complained. Even then the tour guide fought us and told us why should we stop when we have a bathroom on the bus. We alerted them to patrons in need of a stop due to medical reasons and the tour guide wanted to put it up to a vote and not stop. I have never experienced such a blatant poorly planned tour before. I will never travel with Wade again. Bus number 132 date of service 11/30/18. At the very least please retrain your staff for future patrons."",""If zero stars was an option I would have chosen it. I was on a Wade tours bus that picked up our group from JFK. There were a few concerns right away 1) The age of the driver. He looked to be in his late 70's early 80's and knowing this would be a night time drive, with weather conditions, I was very concerned. 2) The condition of the bus which was very old and did not have seat belts. Our group was traveling on the thruway from JFK to Albany via the NYS Thruway. Over the course of the drive members of our group witnessed: a) the driver close/open/close/open his eyes multiple times b)swerve in and out of lanes c) hit the rumble strips on BOTH sides of the roads multiple times d) not use the windshield wipers of the bus in a timely fashion during periods of down pouring rain. He also ran the bus over a curb. The next day I called Wade tours and spoke with Laurie who offered no sympathy or action plan that the company would take to address the concerns I brought up. If you are considering a bus tour company you should MOST DEFINITELY inquire/insist upon a bus with seat belts (our group used a different coach operator on the way down and that bus DID HAVE SEAT BELTS-SO BUSES WITH SEAT BELTS ARE OUT THERE) as well as inquire about the qualifications of the driver. Our group was terrified the entire bus ride and I truly feel we just got lucky  that night and are happy to be alive."",""Wade is your best choice to tra el anywhere...with yourgrouo or Tours provided by Wade Tours.....excellent""}",3.7,"{travel_agency,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

They also had some extra cold weather gear they lent us when we forgot some stuff.

Some of the snowmobiles kept breaking down during the tour and one of the windshields flew off and hit a relative of my in his face. Also know it is very hard to turn the machine, I would understand if it‚Äôs a little hard but trust me it is very hard to turn the snowmobile and it tips very easily, multiple members of my 18 person party tipped and got minor injuries. I don‚Äôt recommend this place because of an incident that happened after that. A relative of mine hit into a tree and damaged the front of the vehicle after  not being able to follow a turn. The guides were nice caring about the welfare of the driver and younger fellow on the back, but the owner had other things to say. He asked who‚Äôs in charge of the 18 year old driver first. Then we were told we‚Äôd have to spend 800$ in repairs, for parts less than half of that.

I spoke to him over the phone about having my malibu looked at because it had alarms going off.  I talked about needing to put the boat in the water and needing to test drive it to see the problem and was told thats fine.  I drove the boat there for over 2 hous, and when i got there he told me he would need to clean it to be able to put it in the lake to test drive, which would be another $200-$300.   Since i already drove it that far, i decided to leave it.  He called later that week to tell me they found the issue. I had a bad knock sensor, and bad transmission temp sensor.  when i picked up the boat,  the bill was over $1700 to troubleshoot, replace two sensors, clean it, winterize, and change the oil; which was much more than expected.  The oil change and winterization was about $700 alone, and the repair was about $1000.  I told the owner that seemed pretty high, and i noticed a charge for $190 in gas.  He said he should have asked me first about adding gas to the bouat at over $5 / gallon. I told him i can fill up the tank for $2.89 on my way home.  He decided to take a little more than $100 off the bill so I ended up paying $1600 for everything, which is still much higher than i would expect.  I also noticed that the boat was not at the marina when i came to pick it up. He gave me some reason that he moved it to some \""hidden\"" lot down the road, but I fell like it was more for protection in case I did not agree with the bill, as if he kind of expected it.  I feel like the boat was worked on properly and should run fine next season, but the price was way too high.  With the unexpected charges and extreem price, i just feel like the owner was not upfront and totally honest, and gouged me."",""Just had my boat repowered by Dunn‚Äôs.

Because they wanted us to have the best experience possible, we drove for about ~20 min away to another site (making sure to extend our flight in the balloon significantly).

I've been going there for years and I like to head down there on the weekends. I find it very peaceful and relaxing. I even have a favorite spot I like to take naps. Though, I really wish they would invest in adequate sun protection. It's particularly troublesome in the fall because of the angle of the sun. 

Once inside, it's very nice, but there is one exhibit that is a bit gaudy. Almost an entire wall dedicated to some sort of sick over compensation for self esteem. Sadly, it comes off as showy and is definitely at the expense of others. It's like a sick experiment of mass manipulation and deceit. It makes a statement of \""I'm better than everyone.\"" and is quite self indulgent. It's also way too much for such a small space. 

If you spend too much time looking at it I find myself pushing back tears. How many years have been wasted? How many missed opportunities? I'm sure this is how Scrouge felt talking to the ghosts of Christmas past. 

There is this one light switch. One of about 200 light switches in the place and I'm convinced it's  a bit of an eater egg. It's always in the off position. You know how switches are labeled on and off? Well instead off and on, it's labled off and slat. Slat? Really weird. 

The switch doesn't do anything. But one time I turned it on and I felt this thing in the pit of my stomach and I would swear my felt my feet rumble and heard this sadistic laugh coming from the floor.

The beach view is just beautiful here and although we only went to picnic, there are tons of other activities and amenities that they offer.

The tent only region is right by the lake shore, on a cliff.the edge is fenced with chicken wire, so it is safe for kids. A few words of caution regarding camping: you need to park in the parking lot, and not by your tent, so plan accordingly. The rest room is a little distance away and the grills are basically an iron grid on the side of the fire ring. When we arrived, it was raining (in the evening) and we could not buy firewood, so that is something to remember as well.

It was hard to get them to leave."",""We had my daughters 6th birthday party here. The kids had a blast petting all the animals. Everyone got to feed a treat to the rabbits and the pigs. They have a pony and horse that everyone can take a ride on. The only reason I did not give the place a 5 is I would like to see prices for party's on the website or posted somewhere. The place is more of a petting farm than a zoo. It is 5 dollars to get in and 5 dollars to take a pony or horse ride. The place is small and keeps kids occupied for a couple hours. Best with small party's or family trips. They do have outside picnic tables and a large room with tables. Will definitely take my kids again.

I usually don't like to be negative but I do think it's important, even for businesses to understand when a customer is unsatisfied. 

First of all, I was having trouble with a piercing (which I did not get done here.) so I called ahead of time to let them know what time I would be there. (I think I called like 5 hours in advance)

When I arrived the woman working sent me away and told me I needed to come back in 30 minutes. I was fine with this, I'm usually a pretty Flexible and patient person. 

When I returned, the same woman helped me out with what I needed and switched my jewelry for me.

When it comes time to check out, My jewelry did not equal enough for me to use my card. As I looked around to find something else to buy I notice the essential oil section. I go to open one to see what it smells like. The next thing I know is the woman working rushes over to me and tells me since I opened it I had to buy it. Her tone was very harsh. She mentioned to me that that was their policy. I suggested to her that they put a sign above the essential oils so people would know not to smell the oils because they would be forced to buy them. She made some very rude and starky remarks to me afterwards. I specifically remember \""Most people are smart enough to not open sealed objects\"". After that I paid for my things and left. I feel like they are trying to get over on people a bit. A sign would help make sure that no one opens the oils unless they are planning on buying them. I feel businesses need to be clear as possible so things like this don't happen. Not to mention the oil I ended up paying $12 for smells really wierd!

It's not hard to stay on the trails themselves (marked by colored dots on the trees), but for a newcomer, it can be hard to know which way you should go when the various trails intersect (as they do multiple times)."",""Nice and shady with creek crossings to cool yours and your dogs' feet.

They have fun bikes that the kids rode over the weekend, but I'm not sure if you rent them or what. 

My only complaints (and reasons for 4 stars instead of 5) are the following. First, when I booked they never processed my card. I called a week ahead to make sure we were all set and they had no site booked for me. Thankfully the site was still open, and I gave all my info again. When we arrived they had the booking but under a different name, so I had to give all my information again. Second, when we checked in we were not welcomed very warmly, and the woman never gave us a schedule of events. It seemed like there were a few scheduled activities going on throughout the weekend (Labor Day), but we didn't know about any of it. Finally, the roads throughout the campground are really, really rough. Lots of potholes, and a few severe bumps. The bumps are marked, but pretty intense.

If we don't have whiners, we usually to prefer to find roadside camping that's free and available throughout the forest lands, many of which have decent parking areasm picnic tables and fire rings, but sometimes you just need to indulge the ones who need to sit on a toilet seat to poop.

The normal entrance is at 89 Fall St., more or less in the center of town. The visitor center occupies a small area at the front of this level while the museum occupies the largest part and the two other floors below. There is no charge for the museum but donations are appreciated.

The museum explains how the town developed around the canal and how the \""falls\"" disappeared with the construction of the two nearby locks. What is particularly interesting is the number of very high profile industries that were once located here but no longer exist. These include the Gould pump manufacturer, a fire engine manufacturer and the Sylvania Electronics company. This company made the first Cathode ray tubes and some of the first TV tubes produced in the USA. Of course there were many other complimentary industries.

You take an elevator down to the second and third levels for further displays. The lower level is at the level of the canal and also houses a boaters welcome center.

This museum will appeal to all ages and is well worth a visit. Allow 1 to 2 hours to browse all the exhibits."",""Interesting local history. Love how the children create Gingerbread Falls."",""Great visit and people"",""Great Museum"",""""}",4.7,"{museum,point_of_interest,establishment}",{}

Cindy treated us to a generous tasting flight of four different wines from Ithaca's own Six Mile Creek Vineyard (a different local vineyard is featured on each Wine on the Water tour). The guests enjoyed this pleasant local wine with cheese and crackers, fruit, olives, and cookies!  Cindy mingled amongst the crowd sharing stories of the boat's history, pouring the wine, and passing around the snacks. She was a real hit with the guests; personable and sociable. She broke the ice among strangers and had us talking to people we may have never had the nerve to introduce ourselves to. 

As the sun set over the lake we sipped wine, grazed on grapes and chatted with Ben the tour guide who seemed to enjoy his job very much. Definitely worth the $50. We'd do it again and again.
